                     <p class="p-3"><strong>JUDGING</strong></p><p class="p-3">All submissions received during the Competition Period will be reviewed (first to determine eligibility, background and credentials) and then once verified, they will be judged by a panel of 5 individuals determined by Sponsor and will be deemed the Judging Panel (“Judging Panel”). They will determine the Finalists as well as winning commissions (both rounds). Judges will include representatives from the following: Representative from the Layan Cultural Foundation, a Representative from the Saudi Royal Family; a Representative from the Local or Regional government; an Award-winning Saudi artist; and an International / Middle Eastern sculpture artist.</p>

                     <p> <strong>First Round:</strong> The first round judging will be conducted on or about March 21, 2020, to determine approximately 84 Finalists (two per Arabic letter), based on the following criteria: Adherence to Theme of celebrating the Saudi Culture/Strength of Concept 40%; Overall Design Aesthetic 30%; and Creativity 30%. In the event of a tie during the Finalist judging round, tied submissions will be re-judged based solely on Adherence to Theme of celebrating the Saudi Culture/Strength of Concept. </p>

                     <p> <strong>Second Round:</strong> The Finalists will be contacted and will have the opportunity to produce a scale model or CAD 3D rendering of their proposed sculpture design (the date will be communicated). They will need to provide a description of the sculpture, dimensions, materials, cost estimate, explanation of durability and sustainability, etc. in order to show how the design can be produced (collectively, “rendering”). They will receive a stipend of US$1,000.00 to complete their renderings for inclusion in the final judging. Judging Panel will provide an exact timeline for completion in order to be included or they will forfeit their opportunity to participate. Sponsor will retain all renderings and will not return any to participants. The second round of judging will be conducted on a date that will be communicated, to determine 28 Final commissioned winners (one per Arabic letter) based on the following criteria: Feasibility of Construction 34%; Strength of Concept 33%; and Creativity 33%. In the event of a tie during the Second-Round judging, tied submissions will be re-judged based solely on Feasibility of Construction. <br>
The decisions of the Sponsor and Judging Panel on any and all matters relating to the Competition will be final and binding. Sponsor and members of the Judging Panel are not obliged or bound to enter into any communications whatsoever regarding such decisions.</p>
<p> <strong>FINAL SCULPTURE EXECUTION:</strong> The 28 winners (only one artist/group per Arabic letter) will have the opportunity to create their final sculptures. They will have 6 months for the sculpture to be finished from time of notification and verification (and an exact date will be provided by Sponsor at time of notification). Winners will earn publicity around their sculpture by being included in the Competition’s print and digital communications, in Sponsor’s sole discretion.  The cost of shipment to Saudi Arabia and installation of final sculptures will be covered by Sponsor. Any extra expenses incurred for any reason due to a failure on the part of the winner to meet any transportation deadline which was agreed upon between the Sponsor and the winner shall be covered by the winner. A standardized descriptive plaque explaining the letter and artwork will need be affixed to, or placed immediately adjacent to the sculpture. (Plaque will be created and provided by Sponsor for sculpture’s final installation.
